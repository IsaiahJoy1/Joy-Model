# Joy-Model
A deep leaning model made for hyperparameter tuning tests.
The model consists of recurring neural networks and regular neural networks. Once the data is put into a MLDataStruct object, in Joy Model.py, a MLProject object can be made. The model will automatically be generated based on the data and data notes. The MLProject handles multiple models, saving a copy of the best one, and simplifies the presses of using and training models. I have used the Spotify API to get training data and I have provided the code it in SpotifyAPIHelper.py.
